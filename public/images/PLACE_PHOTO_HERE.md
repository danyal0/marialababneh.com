   ```

4. **Update Code:**
   - Open: `/workspace/components/About.js`

   - Uncomment the local image code
   - Comment out the Unsplash placeholder

## Current Status:

## Why Not Direct LinkedIn URL?
LinkedIn profile pictures require authentication and won't work for public websites. You must download and host the image yourself.

## Alternative:
If you can't download from LinkedIn, you can:
1. Ask Maria for a high-res headshot
2. Use a photo from university website
3. Use a professional photo from any public source

## Recommended Specs:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 400x400px minimum
- Quality: Professional headshot
- Background: Neutral or professional setting
